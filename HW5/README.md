Assignment 1
********************

TA: I was unable to determine the process for unzipping files in the notebook (For PLUTO). So, while the energy data is uploaded into this directory: Energy_and_Water_Data_Disclosure_for_Local_Law_84__2013_.csv, ***the PLUTO data must be downloaded and unzipped.***

Assignment 2
******************

Unfortunately, as a part-time student, my time is severely limited (I have only evenings a few nights a week to work on homework). As such, I was unable to spend sufficient time on this assignment. Ive uploaded a notebook, but it is not complete.

A note on homework:
I'm generally comfortable with the workload, but for time-management purposes need closer to a full week for each assignment to properly get deep. Especially until I get a better handle on the data-wrangling.
