CLARITY: Title and axes are clearly labelled, it's easy to understand what's being compared. Good detail on Y-axis with "trips beginning in the hour." As a nit, it might be helpful to clarify that "age" refers to the riders (as opposed to the bikes..or the stations...or the data itself). Data is plotted right up to the left and right boundaries, so a margin might be helpful to clarify that the x data is categorical from a specific segment of time (0-23 hours of 1 day).

AESTHETIC: Good scaling. The grid is helpful. Might make the lines a bit thicker to allow to see the difference in colors. Also difficult to distinguish a few of the colors without needing to keep flipping back to legend, but given the uncluttered nature of the plot, that's not too taxing.

HONESTY: There's a bit of difficulty plotting discrete data ('bins' of each hour) as a line graph, since it may indicate more granular measurements of time than it really does -- these are only counts of trips per hour, not a plot of trips in actual time (i.e. by the minute, as the data is measured). A bar graph might more accurately depict counts per hour. To do that with multiple age groups, you'd have to plot clustered bars at each hour (1 for each age group), which may be too cluttered in one plot, but something that might be considered.

SUGGESTIONS: Other than considering what a clustered bar graph would look like, it might also be redundant to include the "total" plot - that is an aggregate of the age groups already represented on the graph, so if the point is to show an overall trend, that might be obvious enough (in this case) with the given sub-groups. Just a thought to reduce un-needed data.
