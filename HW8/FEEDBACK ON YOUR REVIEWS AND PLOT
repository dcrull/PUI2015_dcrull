great reviews, in depth and helpful 10/10
NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================

tick labels too small

title too small

legend too small

too much empty space (remember tufte's rules): the axis could be cut at the bottom and left

nicely color-blind compliant and the colors nicely show some structure in the data



NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================

=====

the plot says color blind compliant, but really the color blind compliance is only important when multiple colors are present. 

spaces are missing between words and parenthesis in both label and title

the 3D is actually justified but the position of the points in the 3d space is hard to read. i think the transparency is attempting to make it more clear but it does not increase readability and the lack of legend makes it confusing to understand its meaning

axis ticks are too small

============

the time series are of very different order of magnitude. thus all of them are invisible and cluster at the bottom . log y should be used.

why is the plot resolution so low?

there are too many time series on the plot. even with log space the result would likely be confusing. 

for the y ticks a compressed notation for the large numbers should be chosen to enhance readability

good legend and good size for the labels.

consider steps instead of lines joining points for time series

============

small tick labels

small axis label (not terribly small but a bit)

the faint colors may not render well in a page with other stuff in it. 

assigning shades of red and blue to females and males does enhance clarity through intuition but it charges the plot with gender issues: more neutral colors are advisable. 

the distribution of the data would probably be suitable to a log scale on the y axis. this would separate the bottom of the range, which now appears to be the same by eye for all categories.
