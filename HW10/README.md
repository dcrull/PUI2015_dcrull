NOTES ON SOURCE DATA:
All the required files are in this directory. The iPython notobook includes codes to unzip, and read those files as dataframes in memory. FYI - the notobook also has code to retrieve these from the source server if necessary (it shouldnt be), but 2000 and 2001 must be manually downloaded as there was a formatting issue I didnt fix.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
I had some basic conceptual discussion with Dara Perl, Nate Webber, Maria Ortiz, and Michelle Ho, but the work here is all mine. Credit to them for telling me about the one-time homework extension policy.
